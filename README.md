HiHi!

The checkpoint item for HTML checkpoint is domiciled in portfolio.html, hireMe.html and portfolio.css. Pls click on hire me on the portfolio header to see the awemazing form that I cooked...lol.

I had a small issue with the hireMe link on the main portfolio page. The link color is different from what I set. I think its cos the link is active. Pls leave a suggestion on how I can resolve this. Thanks
